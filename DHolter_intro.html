            <p>I'm a returning student via a retraining program. My entire team was laid off from Boeing's Training Development division in 2015. I've been a technical illustrator for 30+ years now and hope to incorporate the things I've learned here into future work in technical communications.</p>

            <p>For fun I like creating images in 2D and 3D programs.  I also have played the flute for 48 years which is an enjoyable distraction. </p>

            <p>Currently I'm two quarters shy of completing my AAS in web design. I'm anxious to get out there and start working again. I'm also terrified by the thought.</p>
